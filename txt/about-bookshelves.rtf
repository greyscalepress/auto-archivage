\f0\fs28 \cf0 Bookshelves: One more note about this picture: in those times where our civilization shifts from paper books to ebooks, we discover that other significant feature that paper books had: alligned on shelves, they form a visual self-representation of our persona, that a visitor entering your living space can scroll through with a glance. A bit like what Last.fm does with music, but with more personal options of arranging the collection, ie. defining the importance of works.}
